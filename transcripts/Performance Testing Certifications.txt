Thanks everyone, for joining this clubhouse meet. Let us wait for two minutes and then we can get started. Those who joined new to clubs, if you want to speak, please raise your hand so that I can admit to the stage. Just wait for one more minute and then we can get started. Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining this week's clubhouse. So this week we are going to talk about performance testing certifications. So before we jump into this week's discussion, this week, a sponsor is Red Line 13. If you want to run a scalable load test using the J meter, you can spin up your own infrastructure using Redline 13, and then you can scale your load test. So please check it. Outline 13. Com. And last two weeks ago, I gave a presentation in the Loadtest World Conference. So those recordings are available in the lootetestworld. Com. So you can check it out. There are a lot of good presentations about performance, JMeter tools, et cetera. Available, so we can check it out in the lottestroworlder. Com. And also a couple of weeks ago, I became AWS Community Builder, so I have part of the AWS Community Builder program. I got a few AWS credits. So in the next couple of weeks, I'm going to schedule sessions around AWS. And also I will be giving you the free AWS credits, $25 worth of credits for free on first come first serve basis. So please watch out my LinkedIn post for more details. So we are going to discuss about how you can run tests on AWS and what service you can leverage to scale your test and how you can use the Distributed Load testing framework on AWS. So those things we are going to discuss in upcoming sessions, and also, of course, with the free AWS credits. So please watch out my Lincoln post for more updates. And now let us get started with this week's topic, performance testing certifications. So this discussion is not around whether certification is really mandatory because everybody has their own opinion whether they want to go with the certifications or not. So this discussion is not about whether you want certifications or whether you mandate the certifications, et cetera. So this discussion is going to focus only on various certifications available in the industry and which one you can choose to upskill yourself. So that is the objective of this particular session. So it is not about debate around whether you want it or you need it. It's nothing about that. So I'm just giving you whatever things I have collected from so many years. So I'm going to present those details to you guys so you can decide which one you want to go for, which one you want to focus in your career. So this discussion, I need a couple of folks to speak up first because I'm not going to talk only myself around. So please raise your hand so that I can admit to the stage, you can introduce yourself and then you can just tell what certifications you have completed in the past, what certifications you are preparing now or what certifications you are going to achieve in future. So if you share those details, it'd be a good start for us to get some background. So anybody interested to share their inputs, please raise your hand so that I can admit to the stage. So we have a couple of folks raise their hands and just submitting them, so I would expect everybody to speak up, please. Because if I am speaking alone for duration, that will not be good. So I want some kind of a discussion environment around here. Hi, Emman. Thanks for joining. Hi, Eminem. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. Thanks for joining. How are you? I'm doing fine. Thanks. Good. Thanks for joining.
Basically, I have done the certifications across Loadowners nine five, and I think it's more expired.
Also.
New Load certified professional from New Ties, the Splunk Basic certification. And currently I'm preparing for AWS Solution Architect certification because it's been a while like I'm working on AWS, but there are lot of services which I'm not aware of, so that actually hinders my performance in day to day life. So I'm preparing for that. And yeah, that's it.
Okay. Cool. Yeah, that's a lot of certifications. Thank you for sharing it.
I just have a few questions around this.
Maybe. I'll sure. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. For those who join you, please raise your hand and share your certification journey so that it will be benefit for everybody. I'm just updating a couple of folks here again. Hi, AJ. Thanks for joining us.
Hi, nanny Audible yes, it's very loud.
Actually.
I haven't done any pay certifications, but as of J Meter, I have done the Blaze Meter certifications, like the Intro certificate I have done. And I'm planning to do the Blast Meter Pro certificate for JMeter. So these are the two which I have done recently.
Okay, cool. So any other apart from performance testing related certification, any other thing you have achieved something like that?
No, actually, in Hacker rank, I completed some of the courses like JavaScript and Python. So other than that, no certifications.
Okay. Thank you for sharing your experience. Anybody from the audience you want to speak up, please raise your hand and share your certification journey, please. Okay, fine. Let us get started. So in my GitHub repository, if you are following me in GitHub, I have a repository for the performance testing certifications where I've listed all the industry standard. Industry standard. Actually, I mean, frequently used tools, solutions and their certifications. So starting from as you know, as a performance engineer, we always started our journey with the load on the most of us and the J meter. So when it comes to Load runner, they have multiple certifications. And unfortunately, it is not free. So you have to pay for the certification and paying and if you want to register for certification, it's kind of a very long process. So I'm not sure how many of you get certified recently. They made the process like it's very stringent process. So you need to plan at least one week before. If you want to give some attempt, you have to plan at least one week ahead. And there are a lot of communication back and forth with the certification team. So the process is very stringent. And I think I'm not sure how many dollars it is again 150 or $200, and you get some 40 questions. And mostly it is kind of an open book. So that's the good thing with load owner, and you can get certified with the load owner, and then you will get the certificate immediately. But only thing is $200. And if you see the topics again, it is very broad topics. So even if you are experienced engineer with ten years of experience in first attempt, you may not be able to clear that certification. So that's the drawback. And in the past I have interacted with the load on the team, whoever created that particular training and certification structure, and then they told they are going to revamp the whole thing again. And from past one year I've been waiting, but no updates from them. But I hope for next year there will be some lot of changes in the Load Runner certification, so that's the update I have with respect to Load Runner. And if you want to start preparing for load render, mainly documentation is very important. You have to go through all the topics, whatever there in the help documentation, you have to just read it like a novel, at least not the functions. At least at least you have to go through all the other stuff like what is controller, what is analysis, what is true client maker, visualization view, Gen data parameterization. So those things you have to touch base, it's a must, actually. And the functions again, there are a lot of functions available, so it is not possible to go through all the functions in Load Runner. Really, it is not possible. And also if you want to focus on protocol, you need to focus on STTP. That is must and a true client. And sometimes I got some questions from Oracle protocol as well. So those things you have to concentrate if you are planning for load on it. But first attempt if you are clear. Yeah, it's well and good. But most of the people I have seen they don't pass it in the first attempt. So I passed in first attempt, but even for me also, it was very tough. I think I cracked on the borderline, not the borderline, just a couple of questions for the borderline. So it's kind of tough situation. So if you want to give a load on Earth, so please keep this in mind and it will not expire. I guess I think the newer version it will not expire. I'm not sure about the older version of Load on that, but the newer version doesn't expire. So that's the points about the load on the certifications. So if you have any questions you can ask me on load earner. Okay. And Microfocus also gives there is an option to appear for Silk Performer. I'm not sure how many of you work on Silk Performer. Again, if you want to get certified in Silk Performer, you can go with the Silk Performer tool as well. So you may ask. Okay, is it the certification really required? So yes or no, my answer would be because when I was talking in the initial stage, there was some requirement from the client side where they expect the certification. So if you certified in Load earner, then there are a lot of chance you can easily get into the project. And if you are not certified, then they will look for the number of years of experience. So it depends on what the client you are going to work. So if the client is mandate the certification, then you need to get the certification. Otherwise you need to just learn by yourself and get experienced by working with the various projects. Okay. So if you have any questions or load on the certification, you can raise your hand. I can admit to the stage Performance Center. I have not seen any certification on that. It's only for Load Runner. I think they have multiple levels in Load Runner. Now the recent certification actually, but for Performance Center, I have not seen anything for PC. Okay, but you can check it out in the Microfocus training site. Double check. Sure, I will let you. Thanks. Okay. Next thing in the performance testing in the performance engineering field. Again after Loading, people always look for J Meter, right? So J Meter, as you know, it is an open source community. It's a community driven tool. So there is no standard certification for J Meter. So Apache Foundation doesn't run any certification program, but instead you can look for a Blaze meter. So Blaze Meter is a free certification. Again, they have two flavors. I think basic and pro. Again, if you go through the Bliss Meter University, you can just go through their training material and you can easily clear the questions. So it is very easy. You have to just spend four to 5 hours. If you already have experience in J Meter, you can easily clear both the certifications. So again, you can reattampt as many times you want by contacting the support and you can easily get the certifications from Blasmith University. So their content also, it is good that I have gone through recently. It's not very basic, it is not very advanced. They balance the flavors for the both basic and pro. And if you want to pay for the JMeter certifications again, there is an institution called V Skills. So V Skills again it's based on India. So they have the JMeter tester program where you have to pay Rs3500. So if you pay and register you can attempt for this certification for J Meter with 50 ghostings 1 hour and then you can get the certification with the lifetime validity. But I'm not sure about the quality of the customs or content of the whether they have training or not. So you need to check it out in the V skills. Again, these two certifications are not like industry standard certification, so it's their own to their own company. If you want to get certified. Yes, free option is Blaze Meter paid option is vskills. So any questions on this J meter. So if you want to prepare for J meter again, working knowledge is mandatory and you need to just see what type of samplers they have and how timers works, how you can record how to plot graphs, analysis. So those things you have to touch base all the aspects of J meter and JMeter plugins and integrations. So you have to focus on each and every layer in JMeter. But Blaze Meter is a good one compared to these kids from my experience because Base meter also is free mainly and they have the training program. Also they have some gamification. So based on number of training you attend, you get some points so you can just check it out in the BlazeMeter University. So again next certification. I want to talk about this new load. So neotus as you know, it got acquired by Price and this so the program. I'm not sure whether the program is undergoing any changes or not. But last time I communicated talk with one of the senior folks in prison test, they are going to change some of the certification program. But if you want to attend, this is the best chance where you can follow the current process. So current process is kind of easy to get new process. I'm not sure how they are going to change the new one, but if you want to get certified in new load now is the best of time. So again new load. They have two flavors which is free one and they have a paid one. So paid one means it is not like we cannot register as individual. You cannot go and register because it comes corporate version actually. So your company has to approach the new load team and then they will schedule some training. Then they conduct some exam. Okay, so that is the advanced professional version, but the basic version is free. So you can just go to the Ty Center or near this website. You can register and then you can attend give this education. But the new load is very tough. From my experience I've been working in new loads for the past two to three years, but first attempt I was able to clear, but it was very tough because again the topics are very broad. It's a new load within your load. There are a lot of topics again within the topic. Again, there is a lot of advanced intermediate basic versions. So again they touch everything. So you need to again go through the documentation. You have to see the user interface. You have to understand how the flow works, how analysis works. What is the network? Even they will ask about the specifications. Right. What server you can run? What is the speed of this particular option? So they go deep load on. I would say when compared to load on. Our Newton is very tough and it will take more time to submit you because there are a lot of questions and the options also, it's very confusing. You cannot easily eliminate the option. So in some of these certification I have seen you can easily eliminate because by seeing the options in survey, you can okay, this is not the right answer. You can easily guess it, at least if you don't know the answer. But in case of near load, everything will be confusing. You cannot easily eliminate the options. So I have seen many people who Ping me in LinkedIn or Facebook, right? They will ask me, give me the dumps. I don't have any dumps. I cannot help them to clear because they have a lot of questions in the bank. So whatever questions I got, you will not get it right. So what are questions you got? Somebody will not get it. So it is very tough to clear these certifications and you need a lot of patience to cover. You need experience in the near load tool. Again, everything is free. You can just download the new load. You have to practice again. See the doctors. You have to practice. So it will take more time to clear certifications. I cleared the border only it's not. I excelled in the certification I cleared in the border, but I was able to manage because I had the training from my company. So they scheduled five days training. So it is very excellent training. They cover from basics to advanced. So that is why I was able to clear, but still a lot of questions. I flunked because there were questions like specifications. So I was not sure. So if you want to give a real certification instead of load or not, I would say you can target a new load to give you a good experience in learning wise. Okay, so any questions on this topics new load on our J meter. So those who join you please raise your hand so that I can admit to the stage and then you can share your certification journey so that it will be helpful to everybody. Okay, fine. Now let us talk about Gatling. So Gattling, I'm not sure how many of you guys are working. I have worked very briefly. So Gatling also has the certification program. Again, it is free. I think initially I'm not sure I think they have two versions. One is the free one and then another version is you have to pay for it again. Gaapling also is coming up with a very good training content, so it is free. You can just go to the Gappling Academy and then you can register and then you can watch the videos and they have a good costing bank. Again, we can easily clear or if you watch the videos. If you just play around with the Gappling tool, you can easily clear the certification. And if you want to go with the advanced level you need to pay, I think €100, I guess 90 to €100 plus tax, I guess so if you pay for that then you can get the Gappling Pro certification. So Gaapling basic question is free. Definitely. Even though if you're not attending any certification, you can just go through the content. They have created nice content by explaining all the concepts with videos so you can just watch it. It is not available in YouTube at all. It is only there in Academy Gaffling Academy so you can give a try for the Gaffling. So these are the testing related certifications and the new certification program is Neocortex. So I'm not sure how many of you heard about this Neocortex tool. If you follow Lloyd Watts in Lincoln. He's a CEO of Neocortex. So where you can run your distributed load testing using various tools from the Arm devices. So armed devices means from mobile phone, tablets and other small devices. So the load will be coming from the actual end user. So we can select the geographical location where you want to sing at the load so the load will be coming from the real device. So they also have the certification program again, it is free and also they reward you $100 reward if you complete some steps. So if you follow the instructions you can Ping me if you want more details, I can share you. So if you follow the instructions, the Neocortex will reward you $100 so it is not like you have to pay. So they will pay you $100 if you complete the certification on Jameter low cost. I think they support a couple of tools so you can check it out in the Neocortex. If you need more details, you can let me know. I can show you the details. So this is the very other way around. So instead of giving, we have to give to that team they are awarding us. So those who join you please raise your hand. I can admit to the stage so that you can share your certification journey. It will be helpful for everyone. So if you have any questions, please let me know anybody interested to share your certification journey? I'm admitting a few folks here. Hey Rakist, thanks for joining.
Hi Navin. Thanks for organizing this.
Navin.
I don't have any certifications in performance, even though I've been working for a reasonable time. Is it necessary for performance team person to have certifications.
When I started the discussion, right. I mentioned this. Actually, what I mentioned is this discussion is not about whether you need it or want it. So it is just to give some knowledge around various certifications we are not going to discuss around whether you mandatory impose the certifications. So that's not the idea behind this discussion. I'm just sharing the various options available in the industry.
And you mentioned about this Neocortex certification recently? I didn't remember exactly. But they mentioned something like a crowd related program or certification related program. Is that what you're sharing?
Correct? Yes. So Neocortex will give you $100 if you complete the series of steps that they mentioned, and then if you submit the subscript and some proof, they will award you.
Okay. And they also mentioned about community performance testing or something like that. Like if you are a performance tester, you can enroll with them and they allocate some work or something like that, right?
Yes.
Hi, sister.
Thanks for joining us. Hey.
Navin.
Slate.
Yeah. Gone through all the most of the important certification. If anybody went to the certification, how about now? Is it good?
Yes. Thanks.
Yeah.
So for everyone, I would like to give an important tip, the tip, which I followed with all the certification I have done.
Like.
And somebody asked, Amen, I guess right. There is a performance center certification as well. They go with members to answer them. So what I follow is I prefer the documentation. So when I'm doing the certification, I don't read the question as I read the answer. That is my thing. So there are some dummy answers you can easily. So if you end up with two or one answer, then go to the question and you'll easily get through the success even if you don't know the version. So some few answers. If they give four options, one or two options will be two deviating from the onset. So you can reinvest such a way. So that tip I want to share for everyone.
Sure. Thank you for the tip. Actually shared whatever you shared, that eliminating the answers. One will work only for very basic certifications. Okay. Yeah. If you want to attend, like, say, CKAD or AWS, right. That will not work free certification, you can easily clear. And for Neolord also, I followed that approach, but it didn't work because the answers are very similar. All the four answers are very similar for most of the questions, and it's very tough to eliminate the options.
That option will work in logical questions. If it's completely 100% technical, you cannot figure it out unless I have knowledge.
Correct. Okay. So for Neocortex, what you have to do is first you need to go to the Neocortex website and sign up, and once you sign up, there are some credits will be available in your account using those credits test to run your test. First you have to decide okay, which two you are going to attempt. So Locust, I think Gatlin J meter. So these three are there, I guess. And I'm not sure about a couple more tools. So if you want to say going with JMeter, so you need to create a script, whatever script you can create some example, com or pit store whatever script you want just to create one script. And then you need to upload. You have to just upload the script in the dashboard and then you need to allocate from which region you are going to run the test. So they support multiple regions like AWS, Asia, US and the other regions available. And based on the availability of the load generators, you need to just select and enter some number. Then you need to start your test and then you can get the results. So it will give you some graphical geometry results. Right. That's the output. And then you need to just share the results with the team and then they manually go through your script, your execution and your results, and then they will award the certification. So this is the whole process right now. Everything is manual, so you need to do it everything one step by step. So eventually they will improve the system. So this is about Jemiter again, same thing you have to follow with Gatling Locust, another tools, whatever tool you want to appear, you can just select and go. Yes, that's the last minute. So what does that mean? The load will be coming from the multiple geographic location from the device. So I have Android mobile. Right. So I used to with Neocortex and whenever my mobile is plugged in in the charger and idle at that time only it will create some virtual box. And then it will create some load from my mobile. So those mobile again, they will reward based on usage. And yeah, that's how the load will be generated to your application on that test. So that is the last mile load testing. So it's basically real users, real device, real users, real location. Nothing is simulated. So we are not doing any IP Spoofing. We are not doing any network virtualization. So it is the actual asset for that also. Yes. So whatever I explain, this is the one. So you get certified. Plus you get the reward. Okay. There's no question and answer. Actually, there's no Q and a format. So it's like a handson. So just create script upload run show. That's it. Yes. Thanks. Now and recently I cleared one certification called Load View. So I'm not sure how many of you heard about this tool called Load View. So this is from Solar Winds Company. So this Load view also, they have a certification. Again, this certification is not easy to. This is a free certification, but it is not easy to clear because you have to enter some text for a few questions and then you need to do certain things to get this application. So if you are interested, you can check it out. My latest blog post in my website queueing sites. Com where I have listed how you can do the Load View certification. So you need to register for the Load view, and then again they will give you $25 credit. So using the $25 credit you need to play around in the Load view and then only you can attend the certification. So if you do directly to certification, then you may not be able to clear on the first attempt. So this is also a good opportunity to learn something new and also for free. And also you can get certified. The one thing very different unique about this certification is if you cleared, you can get featured in the consultant portal, so they have a Loadview consultant portal. And if you cleared, you can propose your details so that they can feature you in their directory. And if someone is looking for a help like a paid gig, then you can help them and then you can get some money. So this is somewhat unique when compared to other tools in the market. So you can check it out. Load View again, the tool also is very good. The UI is very intuitive. I have tried all the aspects, so it was good. It's a good experience to learn something new on your weekends so you can check it out loud view for more details. Again, they support JMeter. They support a lot of protocols, a lot of different variety of tests. Again, browser base retests are there selenium based tests are there. So I think they're continuously improving the stuff. So I'm not sure why it's not being very commonly known about among the community, but it's a good tool for your testing purpose. And also there is an eggplant. I'm not sure how many of you heard about this eggplant. So Eggplant also they have a certification, but right now I contacted the support. They said they are revamping the certification program for the performance testing, but for automation it is available right now. But performance. Six months ago I contacted them to know more about the certification. They told their revamping they will let me know once it is updated. So you can also keep an eye on the Eggplant certification. So again, Eggplant, also I have tried in my local machine. They have also some kind of unique features they have. So it is also good tool. So there are so many tools good in the market, but we are always sticking to the commonly used tools, so that thing has to change. So we need to have some diversity in terms of facting, the tools. So you can also check it out to plant. So I also really like how it runs the features, mainly the correlation features. Also, it's a good one. I don't see it in other tools, but Eggplant has a good correlation features like a smart correlation that they have so we can check it out in your free time. So always we go with the load or load or jammeter those kind of tools. But there are a lot of tools in the market which are good, which may fit in your need. One thing is you need to just explore and do some POC. If you really like it, you can opt in.
It'S open source one or no, it's commercial.
Commercial. They have a variety of offerings, not just performance. They have automation. They have other things. Also.
Okay, thank you.
Apart from the performance testing certifications, as a performance engineer, I recommend you guys to get certified, at least prepare for the Cloud or APM Observability tools. So in the repository. Also, I mentioned Dinetres, newer Lake and other details. Again, most of the tools, most of the certifications are paid one particularly Dinette race. Again, it's very tough to clear. You need a lot of to go through a lot of documentation. You need real hands on experience. Otherwise it's very tough to clear. But New Relic it is free. But again, you need to go through the training materials. So it is not like since it is free, you can just clear on the fly. No, it will not work like that. So you need to go through this training material. You need to step by step. You have to complete the challenges. Then the final exam also is a kind of moderately tough one because it's not just choose the best answer you need to select. You have to work on the UI. You need to just drag and drop matching or false. So those things are there. So again, if you sit for newer Lake, I would suggest you to sit at one stretch. Do not give any break, because if you give a break again, unless you work in New Lake, it is very tough to clear. So if you are sitting for New Relic, complete one whole certification program. It's a lot of material, a lot of training challenges you have to go through, but at least complete it in one stage. So that's what I did because they have different programs, different variety of certifications. You can register for New Orleans, and then you can just give it a try. So it is also worth learning. Newer Lake and Splunk. Also, they have free certifications. Splunk. Again, I think based on the version, it will change like things explored sound. I have cleared. But right now it's a new version. So again, you need to watch the videos. Clearly, those videos and all, it's very highly informative. And again, you need to practice. It is not like selecting. I mean, the trip side will not work. So you need to focus really on the question and answer. So you can easily create this plank certification. Also, again, this is also free. So any certifications I'm missing here, anybody can just kitchen. We have discovered diatres.
Splunk Fundamentals and Splunk infrastructure overview. So these two are two certificates are free.
The training. I like whatever the training they created. High quality training. It's free, actually. So do not miss it, even though you are not in slang. Guys, I just need to go through the training materials and I forgot about one thing. Okay. Pager duty. So page of duty. Also, I think yearly once they will give you the free vouchers. It's free, actually. Again, the training quality is very high with the cool animations. It will take thousands of dollars to create those kind of training materials. So they are giving away for free, actually. So if you get a chance to grab that, please grab it and give a certification. So even though you are not working on the say, like SRE or DevOps or on call, even though you're not working on those things, I recommend highly recommend to check it out. Page of Duty. So again, it is tough to clear. You need to go through. I went at least three times, three times, I went through the tiny material before giving certification, so I was able to clear it. But it's very tough. So just to watch out, probably if I get any information I will post in my LinkedIn post, but I think they valued some $3,000 of training so you can check it out once you have the access. Very high quality and everything is like a challenge. Basically, you have to do it on the screen. So it's very high quality. One. So page Duty also, you can check it out. I think I didn't add that in my.
Is it heavily used or is it only used by a few companies?
No, it's widely used. Actually used for on call management, like incident, escalation the process. Right. So those things. Yeah. Page Duty is again industry tool. If you see major enterprise, they will be using Duty, but on the other hand, they have other competitors. One Council has the same thing and other vendors also have their own internal tools. Yeah.
Everybody got email notification. I think this guy got an email as well as the mobile SMS or something like that.
They have multiple stuff, actually. Okay. Yeah. From your mobile, you can run the business. That's the thing from your mobile. You can easily navigate the hand offs between multiple teams and you can easily get some holistic view what's going on the environment for those things. So it's like a sign of comment, right. First level of modification I get. So if I'm not saying I'm not approving it, I'm not accepting it. Then it will go to the next level. So next level is also they are busy and they forgot to approve it again. To go to the next level, it will go one by one. So they have a lot of features built in duty. Again, certification. They have multiple certifications. Instant responder is there and then they have another one. So those are free again, even though you are not feeling confident in taking certificates, at least watch the training videos. So it will be very helpful. So they also take with a lot of content from Hollywood movies. Also, I think they took some example from I forgot the movie. So the actual Hollywood movie they take. Okay, then they just correlated with the page of Duty features. They'll try to explain the situation in the movie, how they handled it. Okay. I think 2030 years old movie and how it fits now in the digital world. So they correlate those things with multiple examples. It's very good quality training. Sorry.
Is it all the certifications are free or you said fundamental.
No, it's not free. Actually, they will give you only yearly once they give away for free. Okay. Yeah. I think this time around I got the certification last year. Duty certification.
You said two or three years, right?
Yes. Okay.
Fundamentals.
No, there is a situation by incident responder and another one I forgot. Actually, I will update my repository with the details. You can take it out. So any questions? I think most of us would have played Istq. So anybody cleared Istq here previously.
If you want to call yourself as a tester, if you want to get that approval by the chart, you need to have that certificate. I think it's not anymore. Is it the same again?
I also not sure. Probably somebody can throw light on it.
I remember like was nine. That is.
Same for me. I think more than ten years ago I took the certification in Koimbudur after that. Yeah, I don't know. Actually, they also have the performance testing certification. I'm not sure how many of you know, not just the manual process, the manual software quality process. They also have the performance testing as well. I think they have two flavors. So again, if you want to go with the theory part of performance testing, then STPB is the answer. I'm not sure about the price. I think it should be around Rs3000, right? I'm not sure. Okay. It should be less than Rs4000. I guess you need to go to the Proctor, but because of the pandemic, I'm not sure whether it's a proctored or not. So you have to check it out on the website. So apart from these performance testing and the APM Observability thing again, I recommend everyone to consider the cloud related certifications and also the containers Linux. So if you take a cloud again AWS, sometimes they give you free certifications. So how do you get the free certification is by attending the training program. So if you go to AWS website certification website, if you just give your email ID wherever it is asking you right subscribe just to give you an email ID every now and then they give you away some certifications for free. And if you attend this conferences, they give you free credits. Believe me or not, I have around $500 as a free credit. Really. So it is a free money to play around with air degrees. Okay.
What you do now is you attend all the conference.
Yes, conferences, webinars meet ups. They always give you freebies. And those who joined the late. So I'm also giving a freebie because I recently get into AWS community Builder. So starting from next couple of sessions I'm going to give away $25 AWS credits first come first business. So I will share more details in the LinkedIn post. Okay. So they give you a lot of freebies certifications if you attend the programs. So sign up. Whatever you see. Just sign up. You get the details. Similarly for Microsoft Azure. So Azure also they give you again free certification vouchers. Since Pandemic right. They are doing a lot of free certifications. I think as your fundamentals, it's free most of the time. It's free only. Otherwise you have to pay $100. And they also have the multiple options for other certificates as well. So only thing is again, you have to register if you just Google right. As your free certification, you get the details again, attend the Microsoft conferences, Azure conferences. They will give you free certification options. I'm not sure about the Azure credits, but I have seen a lot of free certification options and free training also, so you can look out Google. Also, what I got to know is Google and Dinetres some partnership. And then they gave $300 Google credits. I'm not sure whether it's still active or not, but you have to Google it, but the Google and IRAs there's some option to get some free credits. And also they give away Quick Labs. So Quick Clubs is a platform where you can try your spin up the cloud instances and then you can just play around. So sometimes they also give away free Quick Labs credits where you can spin up your own instance and you can just play around with the multiple cloud providers. So all you need is you need to just go to their website, register for webinars sessions, presentations, blog articles. Right. So just to subscribe. So I created one email ID for these things. So just to subscribe using the email ID and then so that I will get one always emails about these things only. Okay. So if something comes up here, definitely I'll be posting in my Linguine post, but you have to act very quickly. Otherwise it will go away. So you have to be very agile in that. And again, Linux Foundation. So Linux Foundation also they also give you lot of free credits, heavy discounts for the certifications like CKA, CKAD, Cks and other certifications. Right. So mainly this time around during Black Friday holiday season minimum, they give you 50% off. Otherwise you have to pay full money. So I would say just do not pay anything full if you are trying to give away some heavy high price certification like $300. It's a lot of money, right? So just wait for the right moment. If you subscribe to the newsletter, you always get some Vouchers and also code cloud. So code cloud. They also give you 50 percentage off for these certifications. Only thing is you need to just subscribe to their newsletter. You will get the information you can bundle up. Actually, they give you some heavy discounts. If you bundle up some training program plus education, again, you will get a lot of discount. So I will start posting these things because nowadays I know how to get these things around. So I will post the details in my LinkedIn. So any questions on these things here if you ask me if you're taking AWS. So I would suggest do not go with the AWS cloud practitioner because it is good. But I don't see this right fit for us because AWS Cloud practitioner it deals about only talks about the basic things and what it is and which service is for. What if you are a salesperson or if you are a very non technical manager, then you can go with the package. But as a performance engineer, we usually work in the technical side, so I would suggest at least to go with the associate architect or a professional architect or DevOps. So choose these streamlines. If you're interested in data line, you can choose the data science and stuff, but these three are my epics DevOps associate architect or professional architect. Okay. But again, these three are very dedicated focus if you have to start preparing it. So you have to focus only on these things at least for a month with a lot of hands on. Otherwise it is too clear. Yeah. Thanks. Navi. Yeah. You have to keep practicing. That's why they give a lot of credits. Right. So you have to keep practicing a lot of components because you do not know what is the topic you will get in the exam. So you have to learn everything. Actually for associate. I prepared for professional level, so that's the approach I forward because at that time you have to complete the associate, then attend the professional. But now things have changed. You can directly go with the professional. So what I did, I prepared for professional so that I was easily clear and able to clear the associate. So I followed that route. So it is up to you how you want to follow, but it needs dedicated at least five weeks of training, focusing 4 hours daily, at least on those topics. Again, documentation is must. Lot of documentation is required reading I use in Flashcards a lot of flashcards out of there. So I use Flashcards 1000 plus flash cards I used whenever I'm free. Right. I just see those flashcards just like preparing for Greg for AWS.
Did you follow any course or you just followed the content. What they published I'm trying to get my certificate done, but I'm starting and dropping in the middle. So not following any particular course.
I followed Linux Academy course, but right now it's measured with Cloud Guru.
Right.
Again. Cloud Guru measured with plural site. So what you can do is right now it's a good time to purchase the subscription, because anytime soon the Halloween or Thanksgiving rate comes up, 50% discount will be there. So it's a good time to purchase the subscription. And then you can start watching the videos.
Hey, Navin Sagar here.
Hi, Sagar. How are you?
I'm good, sir. How are you?
I'm good. Thank you, sir.
I have a question since we have AWS, we have Google. So which one area should we start first? Which one? Like I'll say in high, we cannot go everywhere at the same time.
Right.
We have to start from somewhere.
Yes. So a couple of things you need to look up here. One is what is the cloud infrastructure your client or your project is using and which cloud you like and which you want to pursue. In my case, my previous client. They are heavily on a base. But once I quit and I joined our company, they are heavily on Azure. So one day I was wearing AWS sticker in my bag and then someone told you, okay, you should not supposed to put it here. This is the way people see. Right. So you need to choose wisely. So what is your interest and what is which client you are going to work for a long time. So based on that, you can choose your certification.
One more question. I'm talking right now. So if we have to do some kind of hands on or something, so will they give us any test accounts to do hands on or something like that or should be just a theory?
No. Aws. You get three credits for one year. And also a lot of credits will be given if you attend their webinars and presentations so that credits will be very helpful to practice on your own. So you are saying also they give $200 credit.
So you are saying you can use those credits for the hands on, correct?
Yes. Okay. And if you see like a cloud guru, right. So Cloud Guru, they have a feature where you can spin up your own machine for learning purpose and then you can just delete once it is done. So it is included in your subscription. So that is the good thing with Cloud Guru. I'm not sure how many of you have a cloud guru. I got it last Black Friday with 50% discount grandfather plan. So whenever I need to do something like, say Kubernetes, I just go to the platform and just a spinner. I think it's generous. You can spin up a heavy machine for free for 30 days since it is active. If you are keeping it active, you can use it daily if it is not active, they will delete it. So it's a good plan. You can purchase how much? I think I got it for Black Friday. $150 or $200, I guess per year. Yeah, you can watch out because they have a lot of merging Linux Academy measured with cloud Guru. Again, plural site bought cloud guru. So I'm not sure about this year's pricing, but yes, every now and then they throw 50 percentage off in the annual plan. Okay, I'm just admitting few folks here. Hi, Shaun. Thanks for joining. Hi.
My route is not regarding certification thing regarding the coding.
Of course. Yes, it's a must, right. Because right now we need to know the language, at least one language. Otherwise it is very tough to survive in the performance engineering industry. Whatever language you are field, right? You can start something very simple or Python, right? You can start or if you are interested in Java, you can start any one is fine. No need to know multiple languages.
Okay.
Any specific things like these are the Mount. Not a developer should know this much like that. Do we have anything you can say?
I cannot set the bar, right. Because every day things are changing. Landscape is changing. Every day we suddenly go rust Python. So everything is there. You have to keep on learning. I'm not expert in any language, but I can script something. I can write some code.
Bad code.
I just started the career for the last three months I started using Jimita. So for the past two years I didn't pay any like we need this code or any quotes from it. Everything we can manage on the tool itself, whereas in jail meter, I think in some places we need the help of code.
Yes, for JMeter, you can learn groovy Java, right? Yeah. You can learn either of one of these tools. Any questions, guys? Just two certification. Otherwise we can wind it up. So what are the things I know? The tips and tricks everything have said. I hope it is helpful for everybody, so anything is missed out. Please let me know or any topics you want to touch. Yes sir. Please go ahead.
I'd like to add up one more certification this 30 days of postman which I saw from your profile and start doing that. So it's really fun and interesting. It's really interesting and quality is good. And it also increased my productivity from what I am doing so far and I learned many new things from that. So I would like to mention that here. It's completely free.
Thank you, Jayford. Actually, I will add these also in my repository. 30 days postman is very again good learning experience. Even though I worked in postman, I did not know a couple of tips and tricks, right? Productivity hacks. So if you want to go ahead with the certification, it is very easy. You have to just follow the challenge. It's very clear. Concise you can clear it for me. It took around two to three days interested in clearing in one shot. Yes, you can do that. You have to follow 30 challenges and 30th challenge will be manually verified by the team. But rest. Remaining 29 challenges are the automated way. So basically they will give you one challenge. They will focus on one particular feature in postman, and then you need to just follow the instructions. Then if you just run a test, it will run the unit test as well in the background. And then it will give you the whether the challenge has been passed or failed. So everything is automated until last step 38 challenge would be manual verification. You can easily clear. So they have touched all the features of postman, which would be very helpful if you're working in postman in your projects. Also for students. Also, they have some other challenge, but unfortunately we cannot take those challenge, but this 130 days postman is open for everyone. So you can also check it out. Thanks for bringing that up.
Yeah, thanks.
The App Dynamics. We didn't talk about App Dynamics. So App Dynamics certification cost is very expensive than other tools. Other solutions $400. So you have to pay for two years already. Again, they have two things. One is professional level and analyst level. So again, I have not worked with Acnamics, but sometimes a couple of years ago. I don't know. Last year I think they gave away for free. Certification was free. I think every once they throw one time, I guess, for free. So you have to just again watch the Dynamics space. So that also you can give us that.
And one more thing.
David.
So if you people are any like APM tools in your projects, just ask for them. They will give you the free certification which provided to me.
Okay.
I didn't know that people like you.
Actually. Yes, I remember. I got one incident like this October, right. So October they were charging some fee. I am not sure how much $100 is then I mentioned. Okay, it is very expensive for Asian folks like India. Most of the testers are there and then they drastically reduced. And then I just asked them for free. I think they gave one voucher for me. So again, if you contact the support, they will be generous. Sometimes they have to give some numbers. Right? Show some numbers. So they give away the voucher for free. So you can try your luck by contacting the support. So that also sometimes works. So octopus so you can check it out. Octopus and what else we have to provide cover Gatling new test load on our IBM also has I'm not sure how many of you IBM Rational certified. So they also have the certification program. So I think that when I was working with Infoses, they connected the corporate training. So they gave me the Voucher for free at the time I got the reservation clear. But right now, I don't know if it is there or not. It's not active from past couple of years, but if you are interested, if you're working in rational performance Estor, you can check it out the IBM website. Any chance you attended the planning? I don't know.
I left Infosys from three years back.
Okay.
But no, I'm in Canada right now.
Canada.
I work in Delta. So in our scenario, they are using AWS and all this stuff.
Right? So.
They are kind of growing in that area. They are migrating all the on premise to AWS. So that is a reason. Let me focus on those certifications.
Okay. Cool. Thank you, everyone. I think that's it. I have. So this week's sponsor is Redline 13. Com. So please check it out. Redline 13 if you want to run the high load scalable test using Jameter and you can check it out. My conference presentation in the lootetestwold. Com that's it today's topic. So if you have any questions, please let me know on the LinkedIn chat or you can Ping me here in clubhouse. I'm happy to help you. Next week. Again, we'll come up with some topic and then we can discuss and thanks for joining. Have a good weekend.
Thanks, Ravine, for arranging this.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Bye.
Thanks, man. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
