Hey, how are you?
I'm good. Thank you. Thank you for joining.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
Thank you. Let us wait for two more minutes and then we can get started.
Of course.
So good.
Good evening, sir.
Hi, Ray. Thanks for ruining. Please be unmuted.
Actually, I'm not a pro. Yeah, I'm very new to this application when I am looking for performance testing, perform, assisting engineers. Actually, I just want to change my job. And as I look into your YouTube channel and I was following you to I subscribed and Im just looking your videos to.
Yeah, thanks. So first let us start with whatever we have an agenda. Then probably at last we can take some questions during that time we can discuss more.
Alright. Okay.
So thank you. Let us wait for one more minute and then we can get started. So if you want to speak, please raise your hand so that I can admit to the stage.
Okay sir. And can I ask you some? Actually, I learned some tools from your site from your channel how to test a load runner and meter it. I got some idea about that.
So we have a particular agenda today in today's meeting. Probably we can take up your question at the end. Is that okay?
Okay sir.
Okay.
Thank you. Okay, thanks everyone for joining this club meet. I think this is our club meet. So we've been discussing about various topics in the past and all the recordings for most of the sessions are available on my YouTube channel. You can go through. And today we have a special guest Leandro who is very veteran in the performance listing field. I think for the past 20 years you've been contributing for various technologies and speaking a lot of conferences, etc. And recently, as I mentioned in the last week clubs, he has published a new book called Hitch Hiking Guide to Load Testing Projects. So last week itself, on the first day itself I grabbed the book and then I spent around four to 6 hours going through all the concepts. I read some page one to pay till the last page. So I was very intrigued. And whatever things we have we have been experienced and whatever things you will face in our day to day life projects, everything has covered orderly fashion. So today Leandro agreed to talk to us. And if you have any questions and whatever later to performance you can ask. So first we will be going through about ten to 15 minutes about the book. Then we can take up a couple of questions and then we can talk more about the book and then we can take a couple of questions. This is the form of this meeting and of course you can ask anything to performance to the Antron myself. And I hope this discussion will be very useful. And also I am running a giveaway so the and generously giving away two books. So if you go to Clubs United. Com 14, you can participate in the giveaway and at the end of the next week I will announce the window and the winner will be getting the e copy of the book. So this is one announcement and I have another announcement regarding Load Test World Conference from Redline 13. So next month we have a conference coming up conducted by Red Line 13. Leander also speaking in the conference, and I also will be speaking about the meter and a lot of other leaders in the industry. They are talking about various topics. So please check it out. Load Test world. Com with that said, Let us start with Leandro. Leandro, how are you?
Hello, everybody. I'm doing good, enjoying the weekend and super happy to be here and having a chance to share with you. What has been all this experience around the book and everything around the content is not.
Thank you for agreeing to be part of clubs. I think this is your pasta club boss meeting. Correct.
Leandro, I have to say I'm fairly new to the platform. I have been on some other Spanish speaking presentations. Or how do you call this clock houses around performance, but I'm fairly new around here. It's okay. Cool.
Thank you. So anyway, this first question right from my side you would have faced in many other interviews also. So my question is why this book? Why at this point, what is the reason to release this book?
Well, it's a loaded question for me a little bit because this book for the ones I do not know. I started writing it around eight years ago, and the reason for it is that, as you know, I'm a consultant. I go to many different projects with different customers and to most of them, I had to explain some of the performance testing topics all together. Developers, testers season performance engineers and CEOs, even people that could get bored with our technical jargon being used in performance testing. So I started to come up with interesting ways, analogies and fun examples to get people engaged and mostly to help them understand. But after several projects I would have a project every other month explaining the same things. Using similar examples, I started to think, hey, why don't I put this into a format that is easier to share with the world, to share with everybody and to help altogether system performance engineer beginners people wanting to learn, even managers that may not have much of an idea how well some of these technical terms work. So that was the reason for the work. I wanted to have a format to share the knowledge, share the understanding, and to help the people to have a good time while learning it. Because technical topics like performance testing can be can be boring, difficult. So my main mission was to make it entertaining and fun to read.
Okay, that's really nice. So what is the inspiration for this book. So any inspiration from other books you have rendered from it?
Well, at the beginning, everything started by trying to explain things in ways that were fun for the ones here that may not be too familiar. I would recommend checking. This is a TV series that was broadcasting, as I said, like eight or so years ago, the dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan, a person that was explaining their owners that he would come into dog owners houses and help them with problems with the puppies. And he would give some analogies like your dog is under stress. He's kind of nervous. He needs some guidance. He thinks he owns you. And some of the ways that he started to explain things. I was like that's applicable to performance, and I even started to use dog whispering as a way to explain. How do we do with testing scripts? The testing script is like a dog. You're trying to train it. You have to walk the same path with the dog several times. Teach him they don't see in color, they smell. So you have to teach. The front end is different when people see the front end, but they see the back end. And some of those things were the initial inspiration, as you can see in the title. I'm a fan of the Hitch Hikers Guide, The Universe, the book series, and that was another expression. Why don't I make it like a story, like something that flows that you can go from the beginning to the end and have a good journey, of course, carrying around your towel. Your test line, I would say, is a volunteer for the ones that have not read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe. It's very important to carry a towel when you're traveling the universe and here as well. It's important to carry your test plan is one of the things that I described the longest in the book, but it's important to have it in an old test. And at last. And this came really at the very last day that I was giving the final touches. I was reading the Phoenix Project, the Unicorn Project, and the DevOps Guide from Jin Kim. Some of those insights gave me the idea of trying to make it more like a story, but stepping ahead a little bit, I want to mimic on a future book the story of a performance engineer in a company that does poor performance and then goes to another one that they have best practices, modern practices. They follow how things should be in a Phoenix Raceway. By the end. I try to apply something from those books on the Hiking Guide to testing products, but there is more to come. There are many topics that need to be covered around from assisting. And as I said, this book, the inspiration as well comes from the PMP Mercure Guides on testing Projects, where I said, I can put all these best practices and steps for traditional testing projects into a format that is found that you can read and you can travel through it in in a way that is like a journey or a video game. And that's something that I also emphasized in the book that do move on through levels, game skills and weapons, game things that you need to move on in the video game. That's another inspiration for the book. I would say plainly. Video games.
Okay, good. So there are multiple things it contributed to write this idea, right? For the book.
Could you say again.
There are multiple things you took inspiration, right? Not just games and a lot of things.
Yeah. It's a big amalgamation of ideas, techniques, stories. And I hope it's a crazy right to read the book.
Or actually, when I see the book, I had a Phoenix project on Unicon project in my mind because I have the expectation. Okay, the story will go. I like a protagonist. He is a performance engineer, and there are some not by manager, CEO, CFO. I thought that mindset before then, after reading a first chapter, then this is not Phoenix like it is a different approach. Then I started reading the subsequent chapters.
It's a journey, definitely, because you have to travel through the chapters through. But as you mentioned, it's not like the Phoenix break. It's not a single character journey, which I have the idea. And I'm working on that story already, but it's a fun walk through guide for the ones that are familiar with video games. You used to get a walkthrough level one, you need to visit the west, get the sword and get the pin, then you need to go to level two and so on. So that's what I wanted to have for whoever reads the book like a guide and say, hey, I'm on phase three of the project. What do I have to do? Okay, let's go back and check the book. What is the next step that I have to complete the automation? I have to do the ten steps for the best practices. This is in that and have the scenarios. I'm ready to move to the level four. So it's intended more to be like a guide rather than a story. But beware there's a story one call good.
And also I would like to talk about the book cover. And actually I was not able to understand the concept of the book cover. I don't know who designed that. Hitting your friend, right? Your friend or cousin? I don't know. Forgot. So there is a guy standing and there are three buildings and there is a volcano and that's a sunset. So what is the message from the book color?
So yeah, it was assigned a friend of mine in Mexico City is an awarded designer, so it's a good cover and it gets my attention. I'm glad that you notice that the cover comes from a very special source. It was assigned by Marc Peron, a real designer in Mexico, and it's about the journey, as I mentioned, is the challenges that we will face. There are different steps. As you can see, there's a volcano. There are servers at the bottom throwing beams of light into the sky. You can see all the horizon, all the long journey that you have to do until you get to the last step of these were thinking it as a video game because the character that you see my friend getting this inspiration, if you you can see on a border of the face of the character has a little message. So I think he was thinking of me and I told him it's an adventure. As I said, like a video game, you have to go on like in order of rings, you will start with the Ring Fellowship with your friends. You'll go through a journey and you will end up in Mortal. Just trying the ring and doing all the steps that you have to achieve in between. And the book cover somewhat tries to resemble that tries to show you that there are many steps, as you can see in the code scenarios, the different areas. And even inside of the book, you see the volcano. You see some of those being represented on what is the journey? There's a kids drawing as well, not by a professional designer. By myself. I did the drawings and silly graphics that you will see inside of the book. That's a reference telling you that being a performance and especially a low testing engineer doing a low testing project is a journey. There are many challenges. There are many adventures that you have to pass through and you need to go up that Hill and look at the whole steps of the product and understand all the adventure that awaits in front of you and that you have to be able to pass through.
Correct? Yes, thanks. And so we have been joined in. Thanks for joining. We can take a couple of questions from the audience. If you have any questions, please raise your hand so that I can admit to the stage and just a quick note. This session is being recorded. It will be available once the session is done on.
Hey, Vin. Hi, Leandro. So I wanted to know if this is also the book. It's like a head first guide to performance testing. Have you designed it like that for Easy Digestion?
Yeah, absolutely. That's also why I put it with silly examples. I think most of us computer engineers, we are somewhat geeks and nerds and we like pop culture, so I had to pack it with references to video games, to video series, movies and common folk pop culture in general. I couldn't avoid putting a little bit of my Mexican heritage. That our thankless and tacos and things like that we mentioned here and there, but it's to make it easy for the ones that are trying to start, not a performance testing because this one goes specifically on load testing, which for the ones who know me know that I am at war for the confusing performance and load testing. Those topics are not the same thing. And the book helps you because I think the most common job that people will get in performance testing is a load testing project. So that's why I think these steps that the book explains in an easy way will help you to understand and start working on load testing projects or working around performance. I hope with that I answer the question, just let me know if you have any other.
Hi Narendra Ken for joining if you have any questions and I.
Hi Andrew. I have a couple of questions. I just started my career in performance testing. It's like three years I'm into performance testing since Navin you already read the book and Leonora of the book like you have been in this performance testing for the past 20 years. Can I get the concept easily? Is it recommendable to a beginner? How can I can I understand the concept and all those?
Thanks. And for your question and yeah, it's the book is intended for you to understand the main concepts in Performance and Lotus in projects. I don't go over specifics around tools. I want this book to help you to understand the concepts, what is at the bottom of every tool, every practice, every process around performance so that once you start on the project, if you read the book, you understand what is required from you. But once you're in the project, you can go back to the book and see what did I have to do here these days and that you will be having an easier time understanding almost every load testing tool that is needed around the project rather than becoming a tool specialist because that's another problem that I see people learn the tool, but let's say they learned Load Runner and I ask them, hey, now this presentday meter, it's a no load is one Gatling or we will just be doing manual load testing, which is possible and they get confused because they don't understand the concepts that are beneath at the bottom in the foundations of performance and low testing. So the book will help you to understand those and hopefully will give you weapons to understand all the tools that are needed around performance and load testing. So hopefully it will give you good guidance on them.
Thanks. Thanks, Andrew, and I am a frequent reader of your blogs. Com, so it's very insightful. So it's very entertaining. Actually, I also used to follow a Nevins QA insect. Com whenever I get time is to dive into these two websites. So thank you guys. Thank you for your thank you and one more thing. An I would like to Leandro performance would be like in the coming next to ten years. If I want to develop a care like, I'm working as a performance tester, how we can develop a career path. So I did some research based on research I found like, first we can learn a performance tool, then we can learn a monitoring tool, then we can learn a infrastructure site. So that is what I was like. I'm a bit confused. Can you please guide me here? How can I develop a career path in performance testing? Like so if I want to be in this So platform for the next 20 years? So what are the essentials? Like how I can develop a carrier path in this domain? Can you please help me give some information on?
Sure.
So the question is a little outside of the topic of the book, but I can give you a quick answer or guidelines and what to do. In general, things are moving right now to continue agile. I would recommend you hardly to understand some of those implementations rather than going around tools that don't focus so much on tools or when you need. But try to understand the concepts around that and how performance impact and what are the difference? And that's something that I want to help everybody to get clear understanding. Not everything in performance testing is around tools or load test automation. You can do very good performance testing without using a single tool, just manually, just using your browser or many others. So I would recommend you get on the newest trends, understand them and how they interact with performance. Don't get your mind around tools only.
Okay, thanks. And thanks for the information.
Thanks, Sandra. I have another question for you. What did you learn while writing this book? And instead of anyway, you have the various concepts in a simple by explaining a simple analogy. So what did you learn throughout this book writing journey?
Wow. The learnings were several. I would say, first of all, writing it's not an easy task. Not everyone can do it easily. It's very different how you think things in your head, how you speak them and how they should be written. You need to learn things like to not to use the passive voice, so time to respect birds, not to have long sentences to basic, I would say literature or writing principles. That one. That why it took me so long because I wanted to write it well and mostly in a way that would flow that it would be easy for you because some other books that are poorly written and probably many of you listening have had this experience where you're reading a book and you're like, I didn't understand. I had to go back and reread this thing. That was a big learning for me because I wanted it to be an easy rate and that was on the writing set, and it took me easily one or two years to start to learn it with the blog that gladly was referenced earlier today I started to learn a little bit. Wordpress comes with some tools that help you putting your ideas together and tells you, hey, here you're repeating words here. The paragraph is too long. You have too many letters. So learning around the Church were Basin men. And on the other hand, the editorial world where that's also an interesting password. You need to hub reviews additions. You have no idea. This book has been what's written at least four times re reading completely so that it would make sense how the structure of good content around the content, how to learn what topics would be critical for the performance engineers reading it and which others were interesting to me, but probably not critical for a a career path. Maybe you can find them on my blog. Here are some other details, but not so critical and I had to sorry in sorry, Ron, I give your microphone. Yeah, in the end. Also, there was a tough decision because I almost did not publish it because the book deals with load testing products in the traditional manner, not around Agile, not around modern technologies, not around. Continues. And I started it out. Is this still relevant? Should I still Polish it? And I had to do some scouting and research where I learned from multiple sources. They were like, oh yeah, we're still doing projects that way in a traditional, even if the team say it's waterfall, we are continuous. We know that most of them are not and we have to do these projects in a traditional matter. It's something that most load testing products cannot be done in an agile way. If you did many steps that eventually as you very well into the elsewhere, I will write a book around agile performance testing, but it's very different and it's important that every performance engineer knows how to do a traditional load testing project knows the basis because the basics displayed and explained in the book are the foundations. As I said, for any performance engineer, if you are trying to ride a motorcycle because it's modern, it's more powerful is ahead, but you don't know how to ride a bicycle or worse, a tricycle. You will have a hard time. You maybe will have an accident and won't be doing the best you could. So it is recommended to understand these principles and I learned that I was starting to dislike it and I know this is important. I learned through a hard way. Unless I would say another learning is a latex language is like a programming language is like the grandfather of HTML, and it's used for book publishing because Pride, the Pride family, my friends, they helped me. We created Provide Press and I'm going to put a small ad here. If anyone is interested, contact changes fully in writing a book. He will help you and we can publish it through providers. But we had to learn this language to make books in a correct order so that they have heading the content, the pictures, that the page and everything around it. There were multiple learning for me in this book publishing adventure, not only around the project. It feels to me like as you mentioned in the cover, it's me that I was going through those volcanoes and servers and landscape trying to conquer this book, book publishing.
Correctly. So this is the first book from Petite Publications correctly.
Andrew, that is right. The first, but not the only. We have one more coming from James Polley on performance interviews, job interviews and a third one around security setups. I believe I can't remember who's the author of the next one, but already two more coming, if any of you are interested.
Sure. Yeah. So how do you submit the team who approved this? Any comments? You got it. When you submit the abstract.
Look for James Foley on any of the social you can find him. He is the head of providers and get in touch with him. Send him a note, an email and let him know that you are interested. The topic, the title, what you want to talk about you being.
So when you submit for this book, right? The picture abstract. Any comments you received, anything specific, you change it. After that.
As I said before, I was ready to start sending it to editorial and publishing houses. Got recommended by my clients, another QA guru and presenter who already published a book recently and he told me you need to have someone to help you and check the book for even as much as I said, I think I learned about writing. I'm not a professional in writing. So I got help from an editor, Joanna, who helps us and getting it finally to something it was more readable. And after I contacted James and I started talking and he said he would be a good idea to get the book to start this editorial house for performance testing books. What do you think if we give it another review with another editor? And so that was it. A second review? Checking foreign consistencies poorly written English is not my native language, so it had to be rewritten again. And that was the main requirement then figuring out who was going to be the cover. As I said, I am lucky enough to have the famous to sign a friend. I got the cover. We design the standard for the books and those I would say were the requirements and the goal. If you have a topic that is very punctual, a 100 pages, mine is longer because I wanted to be an epic adventure, but for submitting, you can get in touch with James and he will give you feedback on what has to be done, what type of reviews? And he would recommend you who to contact to get it polished. I think that's the biggest like rework that you have to do once you contact and making sure that is good for publishing and sure.
Thanks, Leandra. We have Don who join.
Thank you.
Yeah, you can. Sorry, we are getting one.
Let me complete it quickly. I just want to know whether we have an audio version of this book.
Oh, thank you for the question. And no, there is no reversion yet, but you're not the first to ask this, so I believe I should better get working on that and get an audio version around it. It's interesting because the fun parts of the book, half of the book are the examples, the introductions, all the indications that's going to be a very fun part to describe and read. The other half. The boring part, the boring mumbo jumbo, as I call it, is going to be. I don't know how adaptable will it be to an auto version, but I will try to make it as soon as possible, but I am already looking into how to give you all this version as well in trying to translate it into other languages. Let's see how that goes. And if we can pull it off, but the easiest will be the version.
Thank you. And at.
Those who join you, please raise your hand so that I can admit to the stage. And since you mentioned that mumbo jumbo, right. So who kind of this? Is it you or somebody else?
I think it's slang in the US. Mumbo jumbo is like those weird words that are used in in general refer to weird words that you are not familiar with or that people use around. I have I got the term from many movies that I've seen see it referenced. That is like the landing of a trade. And since we in performance testing and it have lots of terms that to regular people may sound foreign alien. Weird difference. Like, let's use a term for that. It's an official and boring mumbo jumbo, but yeah, it's an official then it was new to me.
I have not aware of the term. So it was new. My kid also was asking, what does number jumbo zip from kids book? He was asking. I don't know. It is a technical book.
I'm glad that you not only learn performance, but a new word English correct.
Correct is. And when you write this official number or jumbo section, right? I mean, basically it is easy to write drug section, but analogies are very tough to write correct. So there are a lot of analogies to mean. You took almost every analogy in all the fields. So how did you come up with the analogy for the particular concept to explain? So you revise multiple times. Are you just to fix one thing and then you just improved that part.
So the difference in the mumbo jumbo and analogies and I forgot to mention this in a past question. Another inspiration that I got for this book. If you have read it is the never ending story from Michael or Michael Ende, which, if any of you have seen, it is about the land of Fantasia and Balthasar Asian dogs who travel to this mystical world. And when you're in the real world, this is the first book that I saw doing that the font is different and the color of the letters is different. And when you are in a fantastic world, the font is different and the color of the letters is different depending on the print that you get. I wanted to do that. And if you noticed when you are reading the mumbo jumbo, the font is computer. Like, if I remember, well, is Korean new is like what you have on your terminal. And when you are reading the phone examples, it's a different font so that you even feel that you are in a different place or reading something different. And from your question, there are some examples in the book that I came up with them. As I said in my consultant job several years before, I had to come up with examples to help people understand so many of them. I already had them in my mind. I just had to put them together and in shape so that they would tell the story around that phase or that topic. But there were others that I would like, how can I explain this in a way that will be entertaining, relatable most of all, establishing the report in between the book and the reader so that you would say, yeah, yeah. My mom once sent me to the store and didn't tell me very well what to pick up. And then she called me because I didn't bring what she wanted, but she didn't tell me, right. And that what happens with our correlation. So there were a few that it took me even months trying to come up with what would be a good example of good analogy? Where else have I seen in the world this type of concept is happening. And there were some even like the one with the dinosaurs trying to check if we can clone them from told DNA, like happened in the movie and understanding if we can do some automation because the nations, not all of them can be done or at times we have to do secular things or use different tools. So on some of them, it was really easy because I already had them in my mind. I explained to myself some of those concepts with those examples, but others I had to sit there and think, how could I explain this? And my biggest was, how would I explain this to my grandmother or a toddler, a very young kid that needs to understand this so that they would catch it in a way that they could relate. And they would say, oh, I see is like picking up groceries. I see it what you do now, I understand and that I think the deal another inspiration for the book. Surely you're joking, Mr. Fineman, from Richard Feynman. That was a famous mathematician, physicist and Nobel Prize winner who had this King and said you should be able to explain complicated things to a toddler, to your grandmother, to everyone. And that's that's the key of understanding a concept made me also myself learn a little bit more about.
Got it. Okay. Thank you. And when it comes to the levels, right. So which level you filter, it's very tough to complete. How long? Fire level.
Wow. I do a big point on the book about some of these levels traditionally and many projects. You arrive at them and they ask, you, can you start scripting right now today? Yeah, sure. What is the plan? What is the scenario that we. No, no, no. It just start scripting. And that's what we need to do. 10,000 scripts, 10,000 automation 100, which at the beginning of my career. Well, I'm just an employee. I'm just another break in the world, as they say. And I have to do my job. But I started to wonder, why am I automating this script of a process that happens only once a month? It doesn't make sense. These ones are it's not for load. Why am I meeting this? I would say at the beginning of my career, I had problems with those first two levels because many in the industry do not pay attention to them. Do not do them well, do not have the document at the end. It just fully read an email. So in my beginnings I would say the two first levels were a problem. Meet career when for scripting.
I.
Would say level three, the creation. And probably many of you have this experience. When you are automating, you record your script and you press play right away and check where does it break and start fixing from there, which I used to commit that mistake for several years in my career until our like, if I have the recordings for these steps multiple times, I can identify what is changing Indian. That's what I want to do. So I've been created for the ones that reference my blog there, you can see the ten steps for Bulletproof scripting where I wanted even to pretend that so that when you create your script, they won't break for problems in the script. Many customers will tell me, hey, isn't it normal that Lotus scenarios failed here and there? They had of errors? I was like, no, no, no. My scenarios, my street have zero errors. Zero problems if any problem arises is because the system is starting to fail because of the load. And that was important for me to understand what I was doing wrong and come up with a set of best practices that would help you to do scripts in the most efficient way. This is faster, believe it or not, because if you do it the old way, you are lots of time, several hours or even days trying to figure out why the script is breaking. And with the steps that I convey in the book, you have a straightforward best practice where most probably they won't ever fail and they won't have that many problems. So I would say those were the ones and the last that I had problems in my life. The last level presenting the results. I wanted originally everyone to read my report that had the throughput and response times and the http 500 errors, and I started to put that and the executive summary at the end. It took me several years to understand that many executives do not care or understand throughput HTP 500 correlations. They just want to know the main thing is the system performing. And where should I put attention to? As a manager, managers do not have to be experts in performance testing to understand that they have to fix something or if the system is okay. So I would say the very last level. It's another where I had problems and I was doing wrong for several years until I was like, yeah, managers do not care. My final reports generally used to be 30, 40, 50 pages long explaining everything that happened in the project, but you have to include first page. This is the main thing that we found no technical terms and explain. You will have a problem here, there, here, over there or your system is doing right. That's the most important thing that I can see or I can tell I did wrong or have.
Correct it's actually, Andrew. So we can take a couple of questions as anybody if you have any questions can ask. Leandro.
Do you work closely with Mark Dominance and James Free, right. Were there any input from them in the book?
There were a few, but when I met them, I met them like three years ago. And as I said, the book started to be worked on over eight years ago. So the book was already completed when I met them. But they were a very good source to touch base and check with them. Do you think it's still worth it to publish a book about Waterfall style load testing projects? And they were absolutely that's a problem that we see in the industry. We have products about that every day. And of course, you should do that. So I would say that was the biggest input from them. When I met them. I was already explaining all those topics and conferences on my blog and elsewhere. So they were a very good bouncing board to check on the idea. Very good fellows, by the way.
Yeah.
Thanks, Sam. And for joining. If you have any questions you can ask Andrew.
Hey, everyone. Okay. So I guess two quick questions for the first one answer I can join the lead for the book is the only available in Kindle. Or is there any other place that we can get in a different format. Digital?
No, it's only in the Kindle platform, supposedly. And this is more around the Amazon publishing process. It should be available in other bookstores eventually, but we haven't found clear information on how long does it take? For now, it's only Kindle, but you can get the Kindle app on almost any device that I can think of. Hopefully, that makes it easier. But for now, an electronic version just in.
Okay, perfect. And second question, I don't know if your book covers this. I know as a consultant, you go from project to project, and sometimes I'm sure this customers may have on realistic expectations. How do you I guess, based on your approach, how do you try to align their target to what they have in later production? How do you try to get those matrix?
Yeah, that's a very common situation that we walk into. Sounds like you being a consultant. You're familiar with you. And when I get to a customer where when they have non realistic requirements. And I think that's the very first point that I attacked the book. Why do you want to get a performance or load testing project? That's the very first question that you need to tear out. I make it to the customers. And generally it's from risks. Hey, I'm going to be putting more users in the system. I'm going to be moving it to the cloud. It's a new system. I'm going to be launching it. And the worst one is like, I don't know, it's just a checkbox in my project plan. And I know that I have to do the performance something. So that's why you're here. I want a million users tested, please. And that's where you have to talk to the customer and let them explain. And that's the point of the book. Use all the examples that you want from there to explain to the customer. Why do you think it's a crazy requirement many times as well from the companies that I have worked, a consultant company. They are happy because the customer says, I want 50 automation in my Lotus, I would get at the break and I would say, hey, the Pareto principle and the best use of your money and my scripting time is that you should not automate all your processes. Are you sure you want and you explain to them doesn't make sense. You spending more money, more time. You can ask someone to trigger the other ones manually when they understand. My bosses not always were happy because then the scope goes from 50 to eight. But what should be done? What is correct? What is ethical? And I prefer to do that and explain to the customer. There are other customers that they are so sovereign that they say, no, I want my 50 scripts. I want this nonsense automation. And you come here to provide me that service. Okay. So what I recommend in those situations put on writing, why you think is not the best approach. Send on an email, and in the end, the customer is always right. You have to provide what they are requesting, but you did your due diligence. You explain to them why it's not a meaningful test or why they won't get the benefit that they are thinking. And the book goes over this extensively. I would say it's very important and it's a headache. That a consultant.
All right. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. And looking forward to grabbing a copy of this book, I guess. Lastly, too, from the sound of it, I guess you really go into too many technicalities, but having been in the industry for so long and working on various projects like nowadays, I guess what's your preferred tool of choice for? Let's say.
Scripted? Well, yes, the book doesn't get into specifics and technicalities, but they try to explain the essence of them. So you will understand what is a correlation, what is throughput, what is pacing, what is the load, all the terms that you need on all the tools and to your answer. What is my favorite tool to use on a project? O and non to exemplify? I will ask you this question, what is your favorite tool for eating? I'm guessing you will say it depends what I'm eating and it's the same in low testing projects. It depends on what are you testing? What is the technology even what are the developers creating it on and what is the goal of the price? Because not all tools work for the same. If I tell you here, my February tool is the spoon, but I am going to chicken with a spoon probably is not the best if I tell you. Okay. Okay. My favorite tool is of work. Well, I need to eat soup. What can I do? And it's the same on low testing projects. There is no silver bullet, no tool to rule them all, depending on what is the situation? Is the tool that you need to choose? I don't get attached to any of them, whichever is the best choice.
Best tool is always tricky, Christine. And someone asks, yeah.
We get that often and it's important. And that's why we want to understand the concepts behind the tool so that you can drive them all. I mean, if I teach you how a car operates, if you have to push the gas pedal, if you have to push the brake pedal, if you have to turn on the lights in these situations, then you will be comfortable with an old Bolt Dragon with a big truck, even with a motorcycle at times. But you understand the basic concepts. You don't feel the difference when you jump from Google Docs to Microsoft Word because you know the concepts at the bottom that you need to do. So beware with two.
There is no best tool in the world it is about what is your requirement. What do you need?
Exactly?
So based on that, you can select the tool. If you want to commute, you can go by walk, you can go by cycle, can go in Tesla. How do you want to commute? This is base on your requirement. The same anology I use for my training program whenever someone asks is this is the one I explained. So they're based on your requirement.
All right. Thank you very much. And thank you, Andrew, for taking the time to share your insights in this weekend. Thank you, Erin, for providing this platform so much.
Much.
Appreciate it. Thanks.
Thank you. Thank you. Hint you can go or not?
No. Yeah, Lando. So Firstly, Congratulations on your book release. Definitely. I I mean, even if sometimes I feel like a man is a professional blogger and content creator, but usually to put everything in writing a book is not an easy task. Definitely a great big accomplishment for you. So Congratulations. Firstly, so my question is probably have not gone through Navin review post. But what is the biggest takeaway for someone who is like ten plus 15 years? What is the biggest takeaway from this book?
And thank you for the question. Do you mean for someone experienced?
Yeah, right.
So my hope. And on one hand, I have met many people with several years of experience under their belt that are still doing projects on some details the wrong way or an old way or backwards. I have met many scripters that would go after ten years of experience, still just recording, replaying and fixing what it breaks. And not to say everyone I know the absolute best practice for everything. I try to give these guidelines to the people that may be committing these mistakes and I would say the cherry on the top. Many season performance engineers do not know how to explain these topics to management, to their coworkers or to convey the message why it is important or what is it that they are doing just among your family, many family members? I do that. Oh, we're computer thing. Okay, never mind. So I think that would be the benefit for season performance and load testing engineers. You will make sure that you are doing many things in the best possible way if you know any others and I am open for correction. If you know that I have something that I said doesn't make sense, please make it. Let me know. I am always open to polishing myself, but I want to help people Polish their practices and to give them examples. Help explain.
Sure.
Leandro. Thank you. Thanks for that. And do you have any other an extension to this book further on any latest friends or I know you said like there is not much of tool concept you are bringing into this book, but I mean, is there any extension of the next part of it as well as.
To give you some trailer into the upcoming movie or book. I'm working next on one around agile performance, continuous performance, all these new trends and performance. They will be far from tools. I don't want to focus on teaching you one tool. I want to teach you how to use all the tools to understand them. So I'm working on one hand silly topic that I'm thinking is a per Phoenix Corn project very similar to the Unicorn and Phoenix project where I will tell a story around how to do it. Traditional old performance, fully down into a journey to great a great culture in a company and so on. And the next one will be. I'm thinking of a trilogy for these books. The second one will be on Agile and Continuous performance, and the third one will be more round observability to knowing at all times the performance of your solution a little ambitious. I hope the next one do not take me eight years again. Now I know better. I've learned lots of things, so hopefully this one will take a shorter time.
Sure.
And thank you. Thanks.
Thanks, Andrew. We have wine racks. You have any questions to the author?
Yeah.
Can I speak?
Yes, sure, sure, I can. Go ahead, please.
So my question is just wanted to have some more details about continuous performance. Just wanted to learn more about it.
Okay. The book, this book, the Hitch Hiking Guide to Loss and Products will not help you much, but if you want some more information, I could tell you. Follow me on YouTube. I have the ten year performer Eng for English. I'm starting to explain continuous performance, some topics around it and on the English provides podcasts. Mark and James. They talk a lot around it and regrets. And I are starting to talk around performance topics and wait a little a little. I hope it's not too long for agile and Continuous performance book.
Okay, so any tentative date or the end of the release next year or a couple of years?
I really don't know. I'm starting with just the outline of the content that I want to have on the book, but I really don't know. There are multiple site projects. You know, the YouTube channel, the podcast, the blog conferences and we have here in Mexico. We call it Chasing the Pork Shop. We have to work for food. So I have office hours as well. So let's see how things go. I really want to push this way faster than the first book, but I can't promise they see it. Sadly.
Got ya. Thanks. Android. If you have any questions you can ask races if you have any questing again. Now as the author, thanks for Johnny.
He even Hale and Congress is in Leandro. I just ordered your book, but after I don't buy a book unless until if I know what is there in the content. So by listening the podcast I just ordered online and this question for you to win. So is there any book you are planning to publish?
Well, first of all, thank you very much for the Congratulations and for buying the book. I really hope you enjoy it. I look forward to any review. I'm very happy to see if it helps you. And if you have any comments around it that should be fixed in a second edition or something like that. I'm very happy to. And as I mentioned, I have three ideas in the works. Let's see how those start to go.
The question was truly and and sorry to it.
The question was now in so I was asking now.
Are you planning any books to publish slightly, Andrew myself.
Okay. No, I don't know. I don't have any plans. I already published three books in the past, but it didn't go through because my marketing search. So I started writing books. Then I started creating YouTube and blog.
Let's fix that. We can perfect express try to do that.
Yeah, probably if I get some idea. Definitely.
And I will teach it to be and the land. The question to you is like you mentioned about scripting you have mentioned. So you have any particular blog or YouTube channel?
I have both a few Google and your performer. You will find my blog. It's triple W dot perf senior POF. Com. And on that blog I described the ten steps for Bulletproof scripting. I did a couple of presentations in conferences about that. I cannot remember if those were Spanish or in English, but in the blog you will get a very good idea and the book explains it as well.
Sorry. Can you repeat that link?
Yeah, it's triple W dot SR senior SR per spurs. Com Senior perfect.
And what are the other books like you mentioned from James Polly from Mexican upcoming books. And where can we plug those information?
The next book is how to Manage Performance job interviews. If I remember. Well, I might be mispronouncing the title, but that's more or less around how to pull performance job interviews. And the next one is around security. As I said, this was announced just a few days ago that they were in the works check for flights and James Polley on LinkedIn. I believe he has mentioned those books coming up soon. I don't know the dates again. It's tough work to push a book in the right way, so. But I think the interview one should become really soon. I think James has almost it.
Thanks. Thanks.
Be okay.
I.
Thank you.
Hey. Hello, everyone. How are you doing?
Good. Thanks.
So shout out to everybody. Thank you for arranging the talk. A great talk by Andrew. I just want to lay out a few assumptions and then get to a question when I imagine a product team, a team that leads to a software product. So you have a whole bunch of developers or professionals and they all know pretty much all of the topics involved to a superficial level. So everybody knows what a database is and everybody knows what a back end and a front end is. And they know what Kuber Nets is and all those big words to a superficial excuse me, to superficial level, and they have this single single area of expertise. So, for example, the load testing. So you have one low testing professional who knows it's fairly well or deeply well, and you have one professional who knows. So for testing in general, very well. So what you get is this kind of T shape skill sets where everyone knows everything to superficial level except this one area of expertise that they are very good at. So what I'm getting is my question is, do you think that a book like yours that is very engaging in its way can help to communicate the virtues and the challenges or the all the different aspects of performance testing to non performance testing personnel to the backend developers and the DBAs and all the other. I would like to call them performance testing stakeholders. They are not the actual professional site reliability engineers or performance engineers, but they are stakeholders of that, and they want to understand better the disciplines involved. Do you think that this could assist them understanding that?
Yeah. I think a question of that. Could you meet yourself? I think a little bit. Okay. So yeah. Absolutely. Even a wish. I have a goal for this book is that not only performance engineers with it, I would love Manager CEOs a wishful thinking, right. But I would hope that many people would read it and understand the traits. The track says, why it is important from the examples. That's why my effort was to try to make it as fun and relatable as possible so that anyone would be able to read it. And even further, people that are slightly related to it project a product will get more understanding from reading the book will say that's why the performance engineer was asking me these weird questions, why he wanted to do this. I wanted to do that. So yeah, I do believe and hope that this book will help almost anyone, even the people that helped me editing the book really need people that were the true professionals. Both of them told me, now I know about your trade at a point that I never thought I would understand. Now I know why Netflix has so many people hitting the servers. Problems can come from that. And I was like, wow, I helped you literature and philosophy person understand perform assisting. I'm so happy about it. I hire you to read it, but I'm happy that you got most of the concepts. So I think, yeah, most of the people will get.
Awesome because I think this is the biggest challenge when people think about functional tests. They know about the robotic part, the specific, repetitive part of of functional tests, and they know that there is a small portion of exploratory parts that humans typically do. Low testing, on the other hand, is almost entirely exploratory. It's almost entirely an attempt to explore the boundaries of your product and crash it at some point. So it's a lot more difficult. It's subjected to a much greater degree of uncertainty, and the you call it investigating the crime scene. Sometimes at my work. I refer to this as the post mortem analysis, but it's kind of the same concept that you try to relate cause and effect in an extremely complex environment, and you start trying to connect all the dots and put all the pieces of the puzzle. But it's extremely difficult.
Yeah, in the end, it's an autopsy of pricing, that's a post mortem were tomato, tomato, same thing. And don't even let me get started on QA. In general, there are so many other topics where I think people would get a benefit of understanding best practices, alignments, and why things are important and why so many organizations I see doing it wrong and performance in as you say, the load testing is taken as more or less as an exploratory practice, but I would say that would not be the approach of the end goal. Performance testing. You need to understand it and control it from day one. This is just for load testing projects for when you have to Slam a system that you need to figure out what is going to happen. But and soon to come in the next book, agile and continuous low testing should become more predictable. But on these ones, as you say, it's a surprise you are thrown into a project you don't know. You have no idea what is going to happen. Okay, let's start punching it a little bit and see how it reacts, but that's a good.
Cool. Thank you.
Any chance for Observability Leandro upcoming book?
Yeah, that's going to be the third one in the series. Observability Performance Management and Instrumentation Automation pipelining all those fun topics that it's a thin line. It will be difficult to divide book two and three because they intersect so much. But observability performance management and I don't want to use the term self healing because I don't believe so much in it. But I would say self redirecting is going to be the third book, but I believe most of the people should have the principles of book one and two to understand observability better, why it matters, why does she pay attention and why some of the best practices around it are indicated that William, why does it matter? Because also in some other area of QA or resilience that I feel is widely.
Sorry planning to turn into a full time author because there are a lot of topics to cover. Right. I need full time focus on the correct how many performance?
Hi.
Thanks for joining. I know if you have any questions you can ask Leandro.
Okay, I can. I can ask any question that anything about the Forman.
Okay.
Performance on the book.
Only book. Okay of a gender question. If you want to improve our knowledge in performance engineering was so like if you want to analyze any root causes. So if you want to improve on those areas, any suggestions? Are any books to read in the I.
Gave a brief explanation on how to do some root cause analysis, the post modem as that mentioned, but I don't know that many books that go specifically around that I always recommend. Ian Molino Molino I don't know how to pronounce his name his book. If I remember all the practical performance of the application that is that the art application perform assisting. He gives a very big explanation on so many topics. I love his book. He managed to put together very different and bright topics around performance and federal reliability. I highly recommend the book. I admire his capability to put together and I remember he has a good chapter or module around analysis. But if I can tell you many times to become a good analyst on these sources of problems and bottlenecks have the experience. It's very difficult to because it can be everything or anything. There's no single source. So just keep doing it and read as many books as you can around performance and system engineering that would I have another recommendation the book called Assistance Performance by Brandon Greg.
Oh yeah, that is also you can check it out. It is very expensive. Plus it has a lot of pages. It is very tough to read. Diamond, I think chapter two, it's been three months. I'm reading that's never ending.
Yeah. Can never have all the knowledge around performance. It's a huge area. And if I can say that was a huge challenge for me to decide what to put in the book that's correctly.
Andrew, thank you both.
Okay.
If you have any questions, please raise your hand. Otherwise we can wind up the session. Thanks Andre, for the giveaway and for the knowledge you have shared. And thanks for locating one or for time on Saturday. Are you in a very short time?
Right.
I just bring it on last Tuesday. Then you agreed and everything turned up pretty quickly. Thanks for that. So there are two things. One is we have a load festival. The conference is coming up on October 6. Please go to notes to com and you can register it's free and virtual event. So the Andra will be there and that will be speaking some topic. And there are other industry leaders who will be taking part in this event. So please register and we have a giveaway. If you go to clubs and com 14 the number 14. You can enter into the giveaway and there will be two copies will be given to whoever the winner is next week. So that's okay. Thanks for joining have a great weekend. Thanks, Leandro.
Thank you, everybody. Have a great weekend.
Thank you, everyone. Bye. See you.
